\title{Adamic-Adar index}
\usage{
similarity_adamic_adar(graph)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{an object of class igraph}
}
\value{
A square numeric matrix with size equal to the number of vertices
  in the input graph.
}
\description{
Similarity measure counting common neighbors weighted by their degrees.
}
\details{
Adamic-Adar Index counts common neighbors with weigths equal to logarithms of
  neighbors' degrees. This is a wrapper to an \pkg{igraph} function
  \code{\link[igraph]{similarity.invlogweighted}}.

g <- igraph::random.graph.game(20, 0.3)
